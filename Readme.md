# Rumor Detection Project for STAT degree

Supervised Learning - Deep Learning - Graph Neural Networks - Rumor Detection

The dataset of this project is from Dr.Ma's Twitter15, Twitter16.

## Purpose

This project aims to build a deep learning network to identify whether tweets on online social media platforms are rumors or not.

## Methodology

This code uses the Pytorch and dgl frameworks to build an identification system based on the structure of rumor propagation. Due to the lack of textual information in the dataset, no semantic information is added to the model for the time being.
